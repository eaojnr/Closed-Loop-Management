# Closed-Loop-Management

**This is information engineering to support the management information systems for closed loops.** 

In the chart below, we describe mainly what some of the associated relationships mean to the model. All relatioships have not been infered in order not to clutter the simplicity implied in this diagram. Example, a POLICY can be linked also to a CLOSEDLOOP or WORKFLOW, but for purposes of decluttering, and by showing the a CLOSEDLOOP is made of WORKFLOW and a WORKFLOW made of ACTIVITY, the reader is able to infer that POLICY can also have a relationship with a CLOSEDLOOP. 

In a similar context, a GOAL and METRIC can be linked to any of the entities in the model, but to simplify the view, an exempler articulation of the relationship has been provided to enable "infer the possibilities".  

**Closed Loop, and the family of concerns that affect Managing Closed Loops**

**Entity Relationship Diagram**
In this detailed entity relationship diagram (ERD), albeit also stripped down view, i'm diagraming the details of the classes and base attributes that will be supporting the physical data model. Please note that this is really a stripped down version that is meant to enable capture, in some "fullness", the capability of managing a closedloop based on given goals, ownership, attributed tactical strategies to realizing the closedloops goal, say a set of activities orchestrated in a certain sequence, or indeed a number of workflows - feedforward (control path) and feedback that enable realize the mandates implied for the closedloop. I'll share more about the data databsed dictionery, and a modular set of models based on an entity grouping in the comming days.
